# GiveMeAPassword

## Description

This project was to create the code that would prompt the user to select criteria to be used and to generate a randomized password that adheres to the criteria selected by the user.

This excercise was meant to strengthen my knowledge in using looping "if" statements, Iteration, and array concatenation.

## Installation

When faced with the website, the user must click the red "Generate Password" button and follow the prompts to generate a randomized password.

## Usage

A single click-button is the only original prompt.

From that one button, the user will be prompted to input criteria which will end with the password being generated
